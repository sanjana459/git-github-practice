# Git and GitHub Practice ðŸš€

This repo contains all my hands-on practice and notes while learning Git and GitHub following [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjRZNkhiEU).

Iâ€™m posting all the commands, small learnings, and screenshots to show my understanding while doing it. (Very real, no fancy edits ðŸ˜…)

## Git Init and Hidden Folders

```bash
(base) sanjanareddy@Gs-MacBook-Pro Git & Github % ls
(base) sanjanareddy@Gs-MacBook-Pro Git & Github % mkdir gitone gittwo gitthree
(base) sanjanareddy@Gs-MacBook-Pro Git & Github % ls
gitone          gitthree        gittwo
```

Some basic Linux commands revision:
- `ls` â€” to list files and folders
- `mkdir <folder>` â€” to create folders
- `cd ..` â€” to go back
- `pwd` â€” to check current working directory

---

These files are not automatically tracked by Git.  
I need a command to make sure Git tracks these.

âž” Important thing I learnt:  
> Git lets you **choose** which files/folders you want to track â€” it doesn't force you.  
> For example, I can track `gitone` and `gittwo`, but ignore `gitthree` if I want.

---

### Quick Recap

- **Git** = Software for version control.
- **GitHub** = Hosting service for Git repositories.
- **Git** helps track file changes and makes collaboration easy.

---

### Check Git Version

```bash
git --version
```

> I found it interesting that even when Git adds new features, they donâ€™t break old ones â€” very stable software.

I had Git 2.15.0 initially.  
Updated it using Homebrew:
```bash
brew update
brew upgrade git
```

---

## What is a Repo?

A **repo** is basically a folder where your project files are kept along with Git tracking information.

---

## Git Status and Init

```bash
git status
git init
```

- `git init` â€” initializes Git tracking inside the folder (only needs to be done once per project).
- After `git init`, a hidden folder `.git` is created.

To see hidden files:
```bash
ls -la
```
ðŸ“¸ *(Screenshot here of `ls -la` showing `.git` folder)*

Inside `.git` folder:
```bash
cd .git
ls
```

> **Note**: `.git` folder has folders like `HEAD`, `config`, `hooks`, `objects`, `refs`.  
> **We should not touch or modify these manually** â€” Git handles it.

## Git Workflow Diagram

```

### Quick Summary:
- `git add` âž” moves changes to **Staging Area**.
- `git commit` âž” saves them in the **Repo**.
- `git push` âž” sends them to **GitHub**.

---

## Git Commit and Logs

Commands I used:
```bash
touch testone.txt testtwo.txt
git add testone.txt
git status
```
- `git add <file>` â€” adds specific file to staging.
- `git add .` â€” adds everything to staging.

*(Screenshot showing staged and unstaged files)*

To undo staging:
```bash
git reset HEAD <file>
```

To commit:
```bash
git commit -m "add file one"
```
*(Screenshot of commit message and Git Graph view)*

---

### What are Atomic Commits?

While reading about commits, I learnt about *Atomic Commits*:
- A commit should do **one logical thing only**.
- Should not mix unrelated changes.
- Keeps commit history clean and understandable.

---

### Commit Message Style Debate (Fun Fact)

I found thereâ€™s a debate:  
**Should commit messages be in past tense or present tense?**

Turns out, official Git guidelines recommend:  
**Present tense, imperative mood**.

Example:
- Good: `Add new login feature`
- Bad: `Added new login feature`

*(Honestly feels aggressive, but thatâ€™s the standard ðŸ˜…)*

---

## Git Config: Username Setup

### Global Username (for all repos)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

To confirm:
```bash
git config --global user.name
```

---

### Local Username (only for this repo)

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
```
To confirm:
```bash
git config user.name
```

*(Screenshots attached here for global and local username setups)*

---

## Git Logs

```bash
git log
git log --oneline
```

*(Screenshots of the commit log and oneline view)*

## Extra Things I Learnt

- There are so many `git log` options â€” filters by author, date, grep by message â€” looks very powerful.
- `git ls-files` â€” lists all files being tracked by Git (extra command I found useful).
- `git diff` â€” shows what changed but not yet staged.
- `git diff --staged` â€” shows whatâ€™s staged but not committed yet.

**ðŸ’¬ Side note:**  
If youâ€™re reading this â€” donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re slow. Git takes a little time to get used to. Keep practicing small things every day.
